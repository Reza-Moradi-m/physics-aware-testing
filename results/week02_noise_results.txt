Week 02 – Physics-Aware AI Testing (Sensor Noise)

Generated: 2026-02-07T15:24:44

Baseline (no constraints): 0.9778
Baseline (std=0.0): 0.9778

Noise sweep (Gaussian noise added to test inputs):
std=0.0 -> accuracy=0.9778
std=0.1 -> accuracy=0.9800
std=0.2 -> accuracy=0.9800
std=0.3 -> accuracy=0.9778
std=0.5 -> accuracy=0.9667
std=0.8 -> accuracy=0.9356
std=1.0 -> accuracy=0.9111

Observation:
Accuracy decreases as sensor noise increases, revealing robustness limits that baseline accuracy testing does not capture.
